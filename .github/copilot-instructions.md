# Copilot Instructions

This is a simple proof of concept for a message-driven workflow application.

## Project Guidelines

- **Use Latest Features:** Always use the latest C# syntax and language features.
- **.NET Version:** This project uses a pre-release version of .NET 10. All new and existing projects must target `net10.0` for compatibility.
- **Use dotnet CLI:** Always prefer using the `dotnet` CLI for managing projects and dependencies (e.g., `dotnet add reference`, `dotnet add package`). Do not manually edit `.csproj` or `.sln` files for these tasks.
- **Keep Documentation Updated:** Whenever you make changes to the project structure, dependencies, or workflow, update the `README.md` and these instructions to ensure the documentation stays current.

## Scope of Work

- **Follow Instructions Precisely:** Do not perform any tasks that are not explicitly requested.
- **No Extra Initiative:** There is no reward for going beyond the defined scope of a request.
- **Clarify Ambiguity:** If a request is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.
- **Suggest, Don't Implement:** If additional changes are required for the project to function after your changes, suggest them but do not implement them unless explicitly instructed to do so.
